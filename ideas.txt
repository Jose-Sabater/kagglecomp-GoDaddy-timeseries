-linear reg with threshold on size /active
- try lazy predict with all features
- try prophet with all variables
-do different approach for different populations:
    -very small counties linear reg
    -larger counties LSTM/GRU


## General

- since many of our census datapoints are just done yearly, maybe we could do a regression with them to map
the growth/decrease for each month. Then we might have features indicating the evolution of those parameters,
which could potentially have a good effect on our model.
